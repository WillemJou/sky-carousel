# Wiwi bank components

A very cool project components for inspire people

## The meaning of it ? üßê

Just for fun actually.

Ultimately I would like to have a fairly and nice components bank made by everyone who wants to contribute and where each can use.

## Components

### - Carousel Random Sky ([WillemJou](https://github.com/WillemJou))

- [Here](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/sky-carousel-ltl8gj?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx) for the runtime project in codeSandBox.io

#### A simple carousel with images that make you want to rise...

It displays when user click on arrows some random (and beautiful) photos of the sky.

Thanks to them, I used the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/fr/s/photos/sunsplash) random https API request to display images and [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/) for...code with ease and class this little project !

#### Made with React (and TypeScript) üòé
