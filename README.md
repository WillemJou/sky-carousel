# Carousel Random Sky

A simple carousel made with [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/).

I used the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/fr/s/photos/sunsplash) random https API to display random (and beautiful) images of the sky.

- [Here](<(https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/sky-carousel-ltl8gj?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.tsx)>) for the runtime project in codeSandBox.io

## Made with React (and TypeScript) ðŸ˜Ž

Like usual, I implement this apps component with the current best JS library :

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB)

## The meaning of it

Ultimately I would like to have a fairly simple and generic component bank to provide those implemented in other projects.
